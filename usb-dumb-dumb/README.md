# Just being dumb dumb with USB

I mean... I'm almost shameful for this one but it seems almost logical to handle the computation on a computer and transmit the result to the ÂµC.
According to my calculations, we need:
3 (colors) \* 8 (bits) \* 600 (leds) \* 90 (Hz) = 1.3 Mbit/s
USB low speed mode allows up to 1.5 Mbit/s so it should be ok.
